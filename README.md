# Quantum Localization: Vibrational Variables as Location

created by Vers3Dynamics

This repo contains a quantum teleportation and vibrational localization demo. It shows how location can emerge from internal quantum state variables (amplitude, phase, frequency) rather than classical Cartesian coordinates.

## Features

- Qiskit-based quantum teleportation circuit
- Bloch vector visualization of state transfer
- FFT-based classical analogy of phase-induced localization

## Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
